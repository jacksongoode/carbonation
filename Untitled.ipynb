Experts say a sea star wasting disease epidemic that began in 2013 has decimated about 95% of the population from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska to Mexico's Baja California peninsula, The Astorian reported.

Visited Carter's Steam Fair yard open day today and expressed interest in modelling some of the engines & rides, particularly/initially the swing boats. Unfortunately they don't keep any drawings, but this chap has done some models of their kit and may be able to help, or at least be a good bet to talk to on the subject. By the same token, if any of you know of any good resources for general drawings or mechanical descriptions of fairground rides, I'd be most grateful!

But that doesn't mean it can be ignored.The best guess is that North Korea now has sufficient fissile material to build 45 to 55 nuclear weapons, three decades after beginning its programme. The warheads would mostly have yields of around 10 to 20 kilotons, similar to the 15 kiloton bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Posted on December 3, 2022 by Ray Flook | Heading into this weekend's 2022 CCXP in Brazil, we knew that Neil Gaiman's The Sandman would be on tap to thank the fans for all of their support in helping them secure a second season. That meant that even though he couldn't be there in person, Gaiman was going to make sure that those in attendance knew how much the love meant via a video screened during the panel- the same video we have waiting for you below. In the clip below, Gaiman promises a second season where Delirium will appear, as well as lots of butterflies, balloons, magic, and… chicken & telephone-flavored ice cream? Also, in case you feel like being jealous? The panel also screened a deleted scene between Dream (Tom Sturridge) and Death (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) where Death reveals that she broke her routine and took a day to feel what it was like to be alive and how she went at herself when the moment of her death arrived.\",\n",
