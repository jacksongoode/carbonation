      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        At a glance, carbonation uses NLP to do topic modelling over the current
        news by grouping similar articles based on headlines (and summaries if
        available!) and provide topics with bias ratings. carbonation allows a
        reader to get an immediate sense of the current news and allows one to
        learn which topics are covered more often by progressive or conservative
        outlets.
      </p>
      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>
        It does so by leveraging the NewsCatcher API to retrieve articles and
        summaries from the most popular news publishers.
